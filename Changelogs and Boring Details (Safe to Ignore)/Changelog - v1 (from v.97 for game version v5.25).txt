BugFixes Prior to v1's Release:
v1.0
General Changes
Applied the if person.race.find('Dark Elf') < 0 || i.code == 'bandaged' || i.code == 'sedated' || randf() > 0.5 fix to Mansion.gd - Reported/Fixed by X3h0n
Applied the if scenedict.givers.has(self) && scenedict.takers.has(i)/inverse fixes to newsexsystem.gd to fix the Genital Size Compare to fix during group sex scenes. - Reported/Fixed by X3h0n
Applied the fix to show fertility and ovulation info for non-pregnant female slaves - Reported/Fixed by X3h0n
Applied the fix to have the Dog Kennel show in the Spreadsheet - Reported/Fixed by X3h0n
Fixed line 2097 in globals.gd to fix the dog father in pregnancies - Reported/Fixed by Darisco
Fixed .back to .back() in expansion.gd for the TitsGrow function. - Reported/Fixed by Darisco
Added in Globals.CurrentSlave to the Job Checks for Events (Guardian/Slaver) per Ankmairdor's Recommendation for the Evaulate function - Reported by Ankmairdor
Set a clamp on Jobskills for 0-100 as well as a one time only notification when a job is maxed out at 100.
Fixed the son/daughter calling the player their son/daughter bug - Reported by Darkness

Farm Fixes
Fixed an issue where hyperlactating slaves milked for amounts over their milkstorage (using the top quality items/extractors) would have negative milk storage and take a few days to produce again. - Reported by zzc & 5_pandas
Fixed the MilkMaid job to pull Job Skills from Milking instead of Milk Maid to show experience properly. - Reported by zzc
Fixed the Nurse and Forager job skill conversation (jobskills instead of jobskill) - Reported by Darkness
Set Farm Manager to gain 1-2 jobskill daily (though it isn't currently called for anything, might as well let them start to gain experience for when it is). - Reported by zzc
Added the relevant lactating stats to the perfect info setting for troubleshooting. It will display prior to text for cattle in the farm.
Fixed issue with the old DailyMilking processing before the Farm and draining the milk during that phase, keeping it from occuring during dailyFarm. - Reported by Hory Shiet, Fixed by Ankmairdor
Split the Farm Invalid checks to separate No Lactation from No Milk in Storage for easier clarification.
Added a Traitmod reset to prevent the check from finding a storage trait and registering it as both storage and regen on dailyLactation - Reported by Ankmairdor.
Fixed issue with expansion 2865 calculating Taurus milkstorage by 120% of regen instead of storage - Reported by Ankmairdor

Lip Traits Change
Per popular request, the Lip Size giving Lisp/Mute has been changed. The base chance is now (25-((LipArray-5)*5)/2), meaning that Plump will give a 2.5%ish chance to give Lisp and every size above that increases the chance by 2.5ish. If the person gained Lisp from their lip size increase, their chance will double per size. The added traits can be removed if the lip size is dropped below Plump as well now (though this will only effect NEWLY added traits, existing saves can't remove the existing Lisp/Mute except in the Laboratory per usual). This has a delay timer of up to 3 days between occurance to space out the events somewhat.

Fetish Conversations
Increased the modifier for the first-time Fetish conversation check from 2 to 3 (to less the "I can't talk about X").
Changed the Encourage/Discourage Fetish Modifier to take into account 1% of the person's loyalty (ie: 50 loyalty will give a 1.5 modifier instead of the base 1 now).

Sexuality
Updated Sexuality Traits to show the Homosexual Trait for "Mostly Gay" and "Gay" & "Bisexual" for "Occassionally Gay/Straight" and "Bi" for compatibilty with other mods [expansion.gd]
