var UmbraExchangeExplanationText = "Select enchanted gear you wish to exchange.\n3 items will be exchanged for 1 random item."

var UmbraExchangeFirstVisit = 'While wandering the market, you find a shop titled "Enchantment Exchange". Curious, you come inside and greet the merchant.\n\n— Hello, friend! Welcome to Exchange! Here we have a big pile of enchanted items, and you can add to it. You give us three enchanted items, and we give you a different enchanted item instead. Sure, most people give us daggers, staves and leathers, so we give plenty of them back. But there are some real gems inside as well!\n\n'

var UmbraExchangeNextVisits = "— Hello, friend! Want to make another exchange?\n\n"

var EnchantmentAccessAsk1 = "You ask the merchant if they can take a custom order.\n\n— So, you want to get something more suited to your tastes than the random things you can exchange here? In this case, I can get you a meeting with the enchanter I work with. But it is going to cost you a lump sum - %s gold, to be precise. Do you agree?"

var EnchantmentAccessAsk2 = "— The deal stays the same - %s gold and you can meet the enchanter. Do you agree?"

var EnchantmentAccessPaymentText = "After taking the gold, merchant leads you to the second store and makes introduction with enchanter.\n\n— Sorry, but I'm not taking orders at the moment. But since you're a mage, I can offer you an alternative - I'll teach you how to enchant an item yourself.\n\n"

var EnchantmentAccessExplanation = "Firstly, some theory. Most enchanted items that you can find is a product of wild magic. Everybody is a little magical, and when item is used for a long time, it gets a little magical yourself. Dagger, sharpened to perfection, starts dealing deeper wounds. Armor worn for a long trek retains some of its owner's endurance. Head butler's uniform gives its new wearers a fraction of old one's confidence. And so on.\n\nBut for us mages this process is too long and too unstable to rely on, so we devised a way to strip this wild magic from one item, and attach it to another. This process is similar to alchemy, so you can do it in a good alchemy lab. Moreover, while wild magic usually only has one weaker effect, our way of binding magic allows for {max_custom_effects} effects on the same item.\n\nOf course, it comes at a cost. To collect enough wild magic to enchant one item, you will need to disassemble {spark_multiplier} items with same wild magic. If you want to enchant a sword with magic taken from a dagger, you will need even more magic. And if you want to add additional enchantments to the item, that's even more costly.\n\nAnd last but not least, you need a catalyst to bind the magic to a new item. This process uses elemental essences, dissolved in a medium. {medium}\n\nAnd now for the process..."

var EnchantmentAccessBloodMedium = "For that medium, your first option is to use the same basic solution as for potions. It is universal, but not very effective, requiring more essences and sparks to successfully enchant the item.\n\nAnd as for the second option, the best medium is blood. For each enchantment, a blood of specific race should be used. Since you got here in Umbra, you can just find a slave of required race to take blood from.\n\nBe careful to not drain too much blood if you care for the slave. Or if you don't, you can just drain them dry, and this amount of blood will definitely be enough."

var EnchantmentAccessNoBloodMedium = "Basic solution for potion works well enough for this purpose."

var EnchantmentAccessMerchantAfterword = "You return to the merchant to inform him that his contact does not accept orders now.\n\n— That's a real pity. So he taught you the basics of enchanting in exchange? I guess this is still less that you paid for. So let me sweeten the deal then.\n\nWe have three piles of enchanted items in our shop: weapons, armors, and everything else. I will let you choose what pile you want to get items for."
