var AliceGreeterMeet = "As you approach the attractive woman, she meets you gaze and smiles.\n\nHer sign reads: [center][color=green]Support Alice, ask me how!\n(This Alice is not for public use.)[/color][/center]\n\nDespite seeming to enjoy being a spectacle, she speaks up only just enough to be heard.\n\n[color=yellow]Take one please.[/color]\n\nShe hands you a pamphlet entitled:\n[center][color=green]Alice, a Guide to Proper Care and Use[/color][/center]"

var AliceExplains = "[color=yellow]I'm Alice, but for you honey I can be anything you want me to be.[/color]\n\nShe winks.[color=yellow]  Sorry, I've just always wanted to say that.  To answer your question, I'm just an Alice.\n\n[/color]She meets your eyes and for a moment it looks like she would explain further, but pauses and fidgets shyly before murmuring that you should really just read the pamphlet."

var AliceDonation = "[color=yellow]Well, you see we need a sponsor and it has to be a mage or at least someone eligible to become one or my master isn't at liberty to act here.  It's really more of a formality, but... you could be our sponsor.  Um, they make me say the next part.\n\nEvery little bit helps in the creation of more Alices which makes the world a better place.  Ahem - For a simple voluntary donation you will now be able to influence the prevalence of Alices in your area.  Would you like to make a donation now?  We have several tiers of support available.[/color]"

var AliceInfinite = "[color=yellow]Oh, wow.  I don't really understand why you're so interested.  I mean how many of us could you handle at once?\n\nWell now that I've gotten us a real sponsor, this Alice gets to start her dream job.  Wish me luck, I hope I'll get to see you again soon![/color]"

var AliceCatchEmAll = "[color=yellow]Oh?  Does that mean you'd want to... collect us?  I mean, not me.  Now that we have an official sponsor here, this Alice gets to start her dream job.  Wish me luck, I hope I'll get to see you again soon!.[/color]"

var AliceOnlyOne = "[color=yellow]What?  Does that mean you'd like just me... alone?  Um, with the sponsorship out of the way, I get to go start my dream job, but I would really like it if you'd come to visit me.[/color]"
