Large marble buildings of elvish design line the streets and provide shelter to the local residents. Despite their lavish architecture they look dilapidated and unkempt. Sections of the city seem almost deserted. While the streets are far from crowded by  the elves that live here, you are often rudely jostled and bumped. Other elves simply glare at you or cautiously give you lots of space.\n\nThe unwelcoming attitude explains why so few outsiders especially those of other races are to be found within the city.",
