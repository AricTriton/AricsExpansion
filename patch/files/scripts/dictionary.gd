		text = "[center]Magical branding[/center]\n\nMagical branding is one of the oldest and most common spells currently used. The procedure of applying one is relatively simple, and only requires the Brander to put their hands around the neck of the one to be branded, as if to strangle them when applying this spell. This allows for the Brander’s blood to be enchanted and infused onto the Branded. As a result, barely visible symbols appear on the neck of the Branded, coiling around and allowing them to be returned to their owner if necessary. The entire procedure is relatively painful for those branded though, as their body is being affected by foreign biology.\n\nBranding is the first thing anyone would want to do to their new human property; and it is expected to be done, as branded people are universally recognized as slaves. Not only that, but branding provides very important measures against rebellion, as a branded person will not be able to inflict any sort of harm on the Brander. The spell prevents any actions influenced by such thoughts and causes paralysis by blocking signals to the spinal cord and inflicting pain and nausea in return.\n\nRecognition of a brand makes it a decent measure against escape attempts, as branded people, while not usually returned to their masters if found far away, quickly end up in very bad conditions; exploited by commoners or taken by local governments to occupy dangerous and unpleasant jobs. Being branded basically lowers a person's rights to that of an object to be used.\n\nMagical branding was most likely developed by elvenkind. Long ago, their magical powers allowed them to control some of the fiercest creatures thanks to this technique. In modern times, its use has become a part of everyday life, as apparently human beings can be easily subdued by their equals.\n\nThere's 3 ways to remove a brand. First, the owner can perform a simple spell, clearing the Branded of their influence if they find that they need to do so. Secondly, the brand will disappear if the Brander happens to die. Lastly, there's the option of having a brand dispelled by skilled mages, although this is generally prohibited by law, and one would be challenged to find a person who would be willing to risk performing such ritual. Needless to say, normal branding is impossible if the living being has already been branded as the current brand prevents it.",

Humans are led by groups of magi who, many centuries in the past, have established control over many towns. The Order of Magi play the role of government in each corresponding region, but they also comply with the High Order located in The Capital, which may assume control in the event of danger.\n\nThe Order is not just a governing structure, but also plays a primal role in magical and technological research and warfare. Hence every person in The Order is not necessarily a mage, but powerful and rich people often join it, as members receive special privileges over normal people and are able to participate in lawmaking and management. At the same time they contribute to The Order and the city by playing a role in various activities, providing money, people, or property as needed. In this way, The Order was able to maintain itself for a very long time, even after the role of magic became less vital for survival.\n\nMagi Orders are led by Grand Mages who are elected by members of The Order every 10 years and who must also meet the needs of the High Order. The High Order, instead, is led by a small group of individuals.\n\nThe High Order operates and plans in every location and provides directives and goals for smaller instances, but those still have enough freedom to act on their own; basically acting in unison like a federation. At the legislative level, there aren’t any real prejudices against any other humanoid race, as they are all regarded in the same manner that any human would be. However, occasional domestic conflicts may raise up, as it is in society's nature to look for a common enemy."

Slaves are generally used for small tasks and as valuable sources of mana for mages. With food production being poor,  and its distribution unreliable,  keeping a significant number of slaves around seems almost like a luxury, although in more prosperous regions it's not uncommon for middle class people to buy one or two servants for personal use.\n\nThe Order of Magi regulates the practice of slavery and tracks possible escapees; as in the past, slaves played a massive role in magical experiments. Branding is what defines a slave, but branding may only be performed by either members of The Order or the Slavers’ Guild. The Order keeps track of every local member's marks so that their slaves have no problem being recognized. However, anyone in possession of a slave not belonging to The Order (such as when buying from the guild) must register his slave and brand to prevent his newly acquired property from being taken away. Unidentified slaves are considered to be the guild's property and are generally used for various social assignments and sometimes end up being released after diligent service; eventually even making a considerable career.\n\nWhile owners possess nearly unlimited control over their slaves, they are also expected to keep them fed and sheltered, making it a valid option for poor people to sell themselves into slavery, provided that they are attractive or useful enough to be taken. However it's not acceptable to forcibly enslave locals without agreement from their relatives, and doing so results in a penalty. Relatives are also able to buy out such slaves, but not for a lesser amount than what was paid, which holds true even for non-locals.\n\nGiven the nature of laws, exotic or high quality slaves are often taken by individuals raiding other regions and trafficking captured people for sale. Some mages went a bit further and employed personal portals for easy access to fresh candidates for their experiments.",

		text = "[center]Theory of Magic[/center]\n\nEnergy has always been a part of living beings, yet conjuring it into something different requires a substantial amount of skill. The use of magic usually comes from considerable concentration and incantations, sometimes also involving specific devices to lead or control the flow of energy. Magic can be roughly divided into 4 types:\n\nTransportation magic is used primarily for teleportation and transportation. It is very effective at allowing easy and quick movement across huge distances with portals. It's hard to use this kind of magic with any degree of speed, making it ill-suited for combat in general.\n\nTransformation magic enables the change of various properties of living beings, achieved through the alteration of their DNA. This kind of magic is both the primary and most commonly used type in the present day. Needless to say, it took ages for humans to hone their skills enough to be able to use this kind of magic without posing a great danger to others; but the results were outstanding. With enough knowledge and equipment you can even produce completely new, superior species or improve abilities of existing ones to an unnatural level. Transformation, however, takes a considerable amount of time to prepare. It also requires specialized equipment and skilled practitioners, making it accessible at a professional level only to a select few individuals.\n\nInfluential magic is the simplest form of magic, being that it does not involve any significant changes to the real world, instead only affecting the mind of a target. Because of this, it's usually easy to learn and cast on the go without a huge risk. Effects vary from inducing emotions, making a victim fall unconscious, to complete mind control (the latter being much more difficult, naturally). For a skilled mage it's not hard to protect oneself from this sort of magic either, but in a general sense it's forbidden to publicly use it against anyone but your slaves.\n\nDestruction magic is mostly absent from current magical practice. Due to the nature of magical energy (that it is fueled by living beings) destruction magic was extremely dangerous, as one professionally conjured spell could potentially grow indefinitely as long as it was draining life and energy from its target. Moreover, due to its potency, destruction magic used to cause major pollution and the tainting of an area, inducing all manner of transmutations and alterations to bystanders. Adepts of destruction magic, elves and dark elves, lost all potential to ever use it again after their defeat in The Old War."

		name = 'Hybrids',
		text = "[center]Racial Hybrids[/center]\n\nEvery humanoid and sexually compatible race is made up of some percentage genealogy of it's forebearers.  A being with 100% of a given race is generally referred to as a pure-blood and typically has a generous endowment of natural abilities including at least some combination of Strength, Agility, Magic, and/or Endurance that manifest from birth in addition to and potentially exceeding the maximum attributes of their race.  Beings of mixed racial heritage are known as hybrids.  A hybrid takes on the same physical maximum attributes and is typically treated as being the same as its dominant race.  Hybrids in which a dominant race represents at least 50% of its heritage are know as race-dominant hybrids.  The natural endowments of race-dominant hybrids vary widely from natural athletes and sorcerers to those exhibiting no natural endowment whatsoever.  Some race-dominant hybrids manifest as a special subspecies of their dominant race and may possess unique endowments and characteristics unrelated to their host race.  Beings that are so mixed as not to include at least 50% of any race are typically referred to as mutts or mongrels and tend to be fairly limited in terms of any natural endowments.\n\nAll hybrids that are not a subspecies in their own right posess a racial inclination or inclinations amounting to two attribute points of natural endowment that manifest reliably as a function of the percentage genealogy of the given race.  For example, Harpies posess a racial inclination solely to Agility (denoted as Agility++) with a magnitude of two attribute points for a pure-blood.  A 75% Harpy-dominant hybrid should have a bonus to agility of 1.5 which rounds up to the same two attribute points exhibited by the pure-blood Harpy.  This is provided another lineage or other factor does not detract from this bonus.  If this Harpy-dominant hybrid included 25% Fairy ancestry, the hybrid would also benefit from the Fairy's sole racial inclination, Magic++, resulting in a bonus to Magic of 0.5 which would round up to a one attribute point bonus to Magic.\n\nIn the preceding example, elemental effects were ignored; however in actuality all races with the exception of Humans exhibit some unbalanced attunement to one or more of the four elemental forces.  This also typically manifests in an attribute bonus.  Note that the elemental attunements of a hybrid are the average of those posessed by its various racial components, so breeders seeking to maximize a given elemental attribute bonus should consider races highly attuned to a given element as secondary racial components in a hybrid amounting to less than or possibly equal to 50%.\n\nEach race embodies some level of saturation of Nature magic which is the driving force of life in our world.  Just as with elemental attunement a hybrid's Nature magic saturation will be an average of that of its constituent races.  The effects of nature magic saturation are generally positive, but vary greatly within race-dominant hybrids.  Mutts and mongrels exhibit no benefits or consequences due to Nature magic saturation.\n\nMana corruption is the level of entropy or chaos in the lifeforce of a given being.  Levels of mana corruption are again averaged in a hybrid according to its racial makeup.  Some races are inherently more corrupted than others depending on their origins.  The effects of mana corruption often represent a trade-off and should be considered by the aspiring breeder carefully.\n\nFinally all races react to a multitude of factors in unique ways.  Some of these are categorized as Breeding Quirks, which breeders must consider as to their utility for a potential hybrid offspring.  In rare cases an entirely different subspecies of a given race may be produced through mutation via careful combination in a race-dominant hybrid."

		text = "[center]Modern Breeding Theory: Origins[/center]\n\nWhile the mechanics are quite simple, one must have a thorough understanding of the world's races and their origins to select the proper stock to be a successful breeder. For the purposes of discussion on racial hybrids, genealogy in excess of 50% is considered primary ancestry, while anything less is referred to as secondary ancestry.\n\nThere are two main racial substrates underlying most races. First the elves: Elves are the original sentient race native to our world. Orcs and the other varieties of Elf were derived from the original Elvish stock. Humans, while not natural, are the second racial substrate developed and are arguably the most malleable race in existance today. Gnomes, Catkin, Wolfkin, Bunnykin, Foxkin, Tanuki, Dragonkin and most recently Taurus were all created via transfomative magic from  Humans, though it is debated whether Gnomes were created intentionally. It is the generally accepted theory that Dragonkin, Scyllas, and Centaurs are based on Humans, while Arachna, Lamia, and Nereid are thought to be based on Elves, but the evidence is unclear and it is generally accepted that the creation of these races was an accidental side effect of wars past in any case.\n\nYou may wonder about the other races in existence. Here the debate among mages and breeders intensifies, but there is growing evidence that their origins fit into one of three general categories: direct Manifestations of Mana, Monsters, and the Outer Planes. Dryads and Fairies are understood to be manifestations of nature magic independent of Elves or Humans as they have been known to appear in places previously devoid of sentient life from time to time throughout history. Goblins are actually a counterpart to Faeries springing from the underworld though as opposed to occuring in vibrant natural settings on the surface. Demons while not the same as their ancient couterparts, are understood to have arrived in our world from the outer planes of existence at some point in the distant past and embody forces of chaos and corruption. They are similar in this way but also unlike Goblins or Gnomes in that their life force is not based on the natural order of this world. In terms of breeding, Demon blood can have seemingly random effects on offspring sired with other races. Likewise Seraphs while similar to Harpies in terms of their connection to wind magic are likely to have originated from another plane of existence and may influence offspring in ways harpies do not, sometimes profoundly. Slimes can't be fully dismissed as mere monsters given sentient specimens, but are clearly of monstrous origin. They aren't entirely compatible with other species and their breeding is beyond the scope of this discussion."

		text = "[center]Mana and Racial Phylogeny[/center]\n\nCertainly the physical traits of a given race are often of primary importance as breeders of beasts and men alike can attest; however mages specialized in breeding in particular should appreciate the underlying magical factors involved. Although destructive magic has been effectively bred out of all known races, elemental forces are still interwoven into all living things and some races unevenly so. Here we must allow a disclaimer and a warning for any would-be guild breeders. The mage guild strictly prohibits experimentation with or study of elemental magic itself. In terms of breeding mages may discuss the matter without fear of a guild inquisition; however any such research or even focused discussion as relates to destructive magic will be immediately and severely punished.\n\nWith that said, a basic knowledge of elemental forces and their relation to breeding is helpful. Although the interplay between elements and humors of a given established race is complex and beyond the scope of this humble summary, secondary ancestry typically behaves more predictably. Generally, a given race with a large amount of secondary ancestry from races aligned with a certain elemental force may be enhanced dependent on the properties of the host's primary race. Other mana related influences include Nature and Entropy (also referred to as Corruption, Taint, or Chaos). Nature magic represents a fusion of the elements and may enhance certain races depending on the source and the affintiy of the host race. Entropic mana can be harnessed through secondary ancestry by some host races, but can also have adverse side effects or potentially cause mutations resulting in offspring that may not resemble any of the individual parent races. The typical elemental attribute associations are as follows along with races known to be strongly attuned:\n[color=red]Fire - Strength  \tRaces:   Dragonkin, Demon[/color]\n[color=yellow]Wind - Agility    \tRaces: Harpy, Seraph[/color]\n[color=aqua]Water - Magic   \tRaces: Nereid, Scylla[/color]\n[color=burlywood]Earth - Endurance     Races: Gnome, Goblin[/color]\n[color=green]Nature\t\t\tRaces: Fairy, Dryad, Goblin[/color]\n[color=purple]Entropy\t\tRaces: Gnome, Demon, Goblin[/color]"

While it is true that Succubi sustain themselves by consuming mana derived from the life force of male sexual partners, this process is rarely harmful.  A Succubus is born naturally possessing features in line with its parentage and lives a typical childhood; however, at the advent of puberty, growth accelerates and its unique hybrid nature begins to manifest.  As all but the most well-read magi are not versed in the intricacies of interspecies breeding, often the child, its parents, and any community it lives in are unaware of how to care for the fledgling Succubus.\n\nWhen the Succubus first goes into heat, its limited magical ability to attract the opposite sex often triggers unpredictably.  As all but the most well-read magi are not versed in the intricacies of interspecies breeding, often the child, its parents, and any community it lives in are unprepared and unaware of how to care for the fledgling Succubus.  Each use of Succubus Glamour drains mana from the subject’s life force directly if no other source is immediately available.  An ignorant young Succubus will often become the target of seemingly random sexual advances.  Fear only increases the probability and magnitude of further involuntary uses of glamour which not only compounds lust and aggression in its target, but further exhausts the Succubus.  In such a situation, the Succubus will inevitably drain her assailant by instinct in this impaired state.  At this point despite any injuries sustained the unprepared Succubus, experiencing a sudden replenishment of life force, enters a powerful orgasmic state of euphoria (note this euphoric state only occurs in adult Succubi after periods of abstinence).\n\nDepending on the personality and beliefs of the subject, relationship with the assailant, setting of the encounter, and often the pliable nature of the adolescent mind, these (often repeated) experiences have powerful formative effects on the Succubus.  Possible aftereffects of uncontrolled repeat glamours include short term memory loss in the target as well and often these assailants will have no memory of the sexual encounters and go about their lives as if nothing had occurred.  Lacking academic understanding of their condition and mana flows, many undiagnosed Succubi come to believe themselves to be masochists, nymphomaniacs, rape or semen addicts, or victims of schizophrenia and/or conspiracy in their community.\n\nFurther, mature adult Succubi must feed on mana regularly or enter a state of mana starvation.  Early symptoms include arousal, insatiable physical hunger, anxiety, and small tremors.  After days to weeks the victim becomes sex-crazed and often resists the urge to masturbate chronically only through the conscious application of willpower.  Eventually a Succubi deprived of mana will perish.\n\nIt would be more judicious to afford Succubi a measure of pity rather than fear or contempt.  Most undiagnosed Succubi end up rejected by their communities and/or families as they fail to adjust to their abilities and needs.  Those who do not perish early most commonly find themselves employed as whores.  The famously unlikely success stories of polyandrist and independently wealth Succubi employing several gigolos routinely.\n\nMagi, of course, are capable of collecting and supplying Succubi with all the mana they need to lead normal, even mundane lives.  Unfortunately, few accredited mages choose to foster them as they tend to consume all of the mana they generate in themselves or others through sexual activity, making them a perceived hinderance to household mana cultivation.\n\n…\n\n(The author proceeds at length to encourage fellow Magi to find, adopt, and care for Succubi of all ages, identify and educate couples likely to birth Succubi, and lectures the reader on the moral responsibility of those gifted with innate magical talent to care for the magically accursed.  Apart from the more factual introduction, there is little practical information.)\n\nYou glean from this text, the breeding recipe: \n[color=aqua]Succubus\n>=50% Demon AND \n>=40% Bunny \n[/color]",

		text = "[center]History of Mankind[/center]\n\nAt the beginning of time, the elves were the only race present. They managed to build a strong society and had access to powerful magic, making them the most dominant species in the land. Class inequality played a large role in their society, as the strongest and most noble were the dominant class. Eventually elven researchers made a breakthrough with transformation magic, and thus it was decided to utilize said magic to produce a new caste of menial workers with even fewer rights, as a means to lift social tension from the lower castes. In the process, Humans were developed. They looked crude compared to the elves and they were denied any potential in destructive magic, making them unable to muster any significant resistance to their rulers. They lived shorter lives but had a higher birth rate to compensate. At first, the elves’ treatment of humanity wasn't terrible, but with successive generations humans became increasingly aware of their inferior position. After a considerable amount of time passed, it became obvious that the size of humanity was getting out of hand and the elven nobility needed a solution to the overpopulation. The execution of newborn humans was proposed and implemented in many regions, but a few regions actually let certain troublesome human communities leave and settle on their own. As time passed, humanity grew tired of their mistreatment and, after a series of gruesome events, rebelled against their masters. This led to The Old War.\n\nOld communities of human escapees did not have a good relationship with the elven kingdom, so they were quick to provide support to the rioters and rebels.However, it soon became apparent that the elves would not treat any humans with respect, and they began to mercilessly eliminate the human opposition. This led to many deaths and to human refugees leaving elven regions for good. The Elves reacted with punitive force, but they weren't completely effective, as old communities developed ways to fight back against enemy casters. For many centuries afterwards,  there was an ongoing conflict between humans and elves. There wasn't much that humans could do against destruction magic, as one caster could easily wipe out an entire squad, so many dirty tactics were used. Ambushes, traps and sudden raids became the main tools that humanity used to fight back against their superior foe, but it wasn't anywhere near enough for a successful counterattack, hence there was no end to the war in sight.\n\nDuring this time, humanity formed The Mage Order as the primary organization to lead the counterattack against the elves. Individuals, who devoted their lives to the research and development of all available forms of magic, became the most valuable members of society as their discoveries provided a significant edge that humans lacked on their own. Physical enhancements played a great role in confrontations, as capable individuals were generally more potent than assembled armies. The Mage Order also took every chance they could to study the after effects of the elves’ destruction magic. As the war continued, magical taint spread across the land, giving birth to many twisted creatures and mutants.\n\nSome of those creatures gave The Order the idea to produce animal hybrids. Thankfully, by that time humans had mastered transmutation magic to a great enough extent that they were able to conduct many experiments in that direction. The most successful of these resulted in the beastkin races. Cat hybrids had outstanding reaction times and grace while wolf mutations provided increased strength, a keen sense of smell, and great co-ordination in packs. There was no prejudice on humanity’s side towards their newfound allies, as any amount of help mattered in war. Beastkins eventually made their own communities, although they still kept close ties to their ancestors.\n\nAlthough, human hybrids weren't the only thing developed by the Order. Orcs were an unfortunate result of experimentation on elves in an attempt to allow humans to use destruction magic and bring them closer to the elves. However, the excessive energy of the experiments went awry and resulted in immense physical growth and skin pigment mutation as the Order had failed to hone human genes to support the alien function, and equally failed to reverse the unintended mutations. On the other side, Elven magicians working on transmutations managed to produce better soldiers from common elves - dark elves. They possessed an increased affinity to magic and had some physical improvements,  making them more fit for combat. However, the extreme magical influence lead them to mutate with a dark, tainted skin.\n\nThe Old War finally ended a few centuries ago with humanity winning against all odds. Although many elves were killed during the final sieges of their cities, they weren't completely eradicated. Instead The Mages’ Order, lead by some inner directions, modified every surviving elf to remove their ability to ever use destructive magic again, and prevented the ability from being passed onto future generations. In this way, the destruction once caused by the elves and their magic, witnessed by generations throughout the War, would not repeat itself.\n\nAfter the war, the elves were mostly divided between those who returned to their forests, holding a minor grudge against humans but not being able to oppose them anymore, and those who were assimilated into human society. By law, the Order did not tolerate racial discrimination of any kind, even towards elves, as a way to foster cooperation with manmade races. After that, led by the Order, many settlements were set up among the lands, eventually giving birth to somewhat distant beastkin and orcish nations. The Order also discouraged remembrance of The Old War as a great tragedy of the past, and after a few generations, the commoners had completely forgotten about that bloody history.",

Well, there's two main methods.\n\nConsentual Cattle:\nA kind-hearted farmer with his slaves and livestock's best interests at heart will find that his (and their) life is far easier if he just finds a cow that wants to BE a cow. Now, there are several factors that may make a man, woman, or futa decide that a life of crawling, orgasming, and being sucked dry is better than their daily lives. A few of these are a strong, trusting relationship, exceptional obedience, a natural fetish for being milked, or even just the sheer pressure of milk building up in breasts to the point of pain. All of these and more may help a cow [color=aqua]consent[/color] to becoming livestock when it is brought it.\n\nJust to recap, the chances of success are: [color=aqua]50% of Loyalty + 25% of Obedience + Default of 10 (changable via expansion.gd's setting: baselivestockconsentchance) + cumulative factors of Lactation, buildup of pressure from lack of milking, Fetish: Being Milked, & Fetish: Submission.[/color]\n\nNon-Consentual Cattle:\nA farmer always has a second choice for filling his stables, of course. Any slave may be forced into a life in the barns, but this is likely to end up in a life of struggle, stress, and a drop in loyalty. The only trick to this is that you will have to either be stronger or faster than the slave unless the slave is too tired to resist.\n\nForced Factors: [color=red]You either need equal or more Strength, equal or more Agility, or ensure that the slave has less than half of their energy to force them to be livestock. This will lead to a degrading struggle until they break for your enslaved livestock as opposed to a consensual, happy life.[/color] "

Typically, allowing your cattle to roam freely will be perfectly acceptable for a well-trained cow that won't struggle. For resisting cattle, however, there are the [color=aqua]racks[/color] and the [color=aqua]cages[/color].\n\nRacks:\nA Rack is a metal device which will allow you to bind the cattle in one general location for the duration of their milking. This will limit their ability to struggle somewhat without actually risking them damaging themselves, but getting them into the rack may still be a tough prospect.\n\nCages:\nCages are reserved for the truly sadistic farmer or the truly problematic cattle. Though they are exceptionally effective at squashing resistant cattle and allowing milking to resume, the cages are formed so tightly around the cattle that they are very likely to hurt themselves. Typically it is around a 50% chance plus the amount that they are struggling. Most successful farmers have one or two cages that they only bring out in the most dire of circumstances for new cattle who are yet to be broken.\n\nStruggling:\nTo understand the actual benefit of a work-station, a smart farmer will need to understand how and why a cow resists. A cow who is there [color=red]against their will[/color] will often for a strong mental resistance combined with their actual physical abilities to fight off your Farmhands or Farm Manager.\n\nMental Resistance:\nTheir pride and intelligence will determine how and how hard they struggle to break out, but that will be tempered by their level of courage to act on it.\n[color=aqua](Average of Confidence+Wit * 1% of Courage)[/color]\n\nPhysical Resistance\nAdded to their mental resistance, their physical abilities have a strong effect on their resistance. This is tempered by their current levels of energy.\n[color=aqua](Strength + Agility * 10% of Current Energy)[/color]\n\nBreaking Cattle:\nTo properly break a cattle that has been forced into your farm, you need to focus on a few possible aspects. The easiest way to break a physically strong cow is to simply run them out of energy until the point that they can't resist. If your cow has the willpower of an ox, shattering their courage will prevent them from having the guts to act out on their inclinations. Until you are able to successfully tame them, there are the workstations to help you along the way.\n[color=aqua](Free Roam: +2 / Rack: -2 / Cage: -5 || Restraints: Additional -2 || All changable within expansion.gd > settings)[/color]"

While this means that an unskilled milk-maid cannot do nearly as well as a machine, very soon you will find their hands extracting expertly and preserving Racial Qualities as well.\n\nPressure:\nBreasts that have more milk than their glands can hold are Pressurized. The Pressurized milk always streams out easily and is 100% extracted.\n\nArousal:\nHorny cattle produce slightly more than their prudish counterparts, as their biological functions are geared toward reproduction and feeding offspring.

Do you want your cattle to be bred by random studs or would you prefer to assign one specific stud to that cattle? Either way, they can only be bred if a stud is available. Remember, Studs cannot be actively milked like cattle to be actively breeding.
